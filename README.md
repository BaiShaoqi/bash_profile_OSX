bash_profile_OSX
================

This is the .bash_profile file for my Mac.

If you would like to use this file, follow these instructions:

    cd ~/
    git init
    git remote add origin git@github.com:wadewegner/bash_profile_OSX.git
    git pull origin master
  
Close terminal and open it again.

Enjoy!
